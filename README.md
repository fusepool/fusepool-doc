# Fusepool Documentation

This is the place for official Fusepool documenation. This guide is aimed at developers and users which want to use Fusepool for their own data and enhancers.

The document is currently very much work in progress.

The content is written in Markdown and gets commited to this Github repository. To generate the book use [GitBook](http://www.gitbook.io/).

Feel free to add your own content and chapters.
